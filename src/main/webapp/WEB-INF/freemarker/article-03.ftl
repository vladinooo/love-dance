                                        <br />
                                        <p class="article-text">Whatever you say, fashion is always dictates the rules. Even those who do not make a huge and expensive wedding, still fancy to have such an important attribute as a wedding dance. And why?</p>
                                        <br />
                                        <p class="article-text">Not just because "everybody dance and we need to," but rather, because this is an incredible experience for everyone!</p>
                                        <br />
                                        <p class="article-text">Since I made my first wedding dance for my friend in times when it wasn't a popular activity for a wedding at all - I learnt a lot and understood what it takes to make a perfect dance.</p>
                                        <br /><br />
                                        <h3 class="article-text centered">There are some tips that are my main principles</h3>
                                        <br />
                                        <h4 class="text-dark">Song is important</h4>
                                        <p class="article-text">When I meet couple I ask them about their ideas, their music taste, and future style of the wedding. Only then I can offer the songs that can be a perfect match. If couple already have song in mind - it's even better, because it should be the part of the story. It mustn't necessarily be with particular rhythm like waltz for example. We can find the movements for any music!  It can be just a popular song but listen to the lyric - words are important, as your love story can't be danced with negative context.</p>
                                        <br />
                                        <h4 class="text-dark">Be creative but not too much</h4>
                                        <p class="article-text">In my job I should be careful and just. The type of floor at the venue, type of wedding dress, and natural capability of a couple - everything is important. We don't want to put into your dance such movements that you won't be able to perform. Of course, family and friends will be crying from overflowing emotions anyway, no matter how you danced, but it's better to make the most of the possibilities. It is better to decorate what is given than spoil the dance with unnecessary movements.</p>
                                        <br />
                                        <h4 class="text-dark">Be responsive</h4>
                                        <p class="article-text">My job - is to make your dreams come true. If you want to dance a passionate tango - then we should find a way to make it possible. In 5 lessons - you ask, YES! When couple don't afraid of telling their desires dance always creates much easier and lovable. <br /><br />A good choreographer, is not afraid to tell the truth as it is, and advice on how to do better, because he is responsible for his product - a dance on a Wedding day.</p>
